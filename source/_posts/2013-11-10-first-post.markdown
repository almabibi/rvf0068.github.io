This page is based on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). The
repository for the source is [here](https://github.com/rvf0068/rvf0068.github.io).

[This](http://drz.ac/2013/01/15/publication-list-using-bibtex-in-octopress/) post was useful to include Bibtex references. [This](http://blog.jmac.org/blog/2013/03/30/putting-twitter-back-into-octopress/) I used to put
a twitter timeline.
